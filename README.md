# Landmark Tracker

[LIVE DEVELOPMENT NOTEBOOK](https://seanvonb.github.io/landmark-tracker/)

This was my final for Udacity's [Computer Vision Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/computer-vision-nanodegree--nd891), which I completed in 2020. Unlike the other projects, this one doesn't really produce a standalone piece of software; rather, this notebook demonstrates a mathematical solution to the [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) (SLAM) problem; or, how an autonomous agent (i.e. robot) can simultaneously explore an unknown environment and keep track of itself within that unknown. I'll give you a hint: it will involve some real Greek letter math, and maybe even some LaTeX – how exciting!

## Features

- Create and visualize an autonomous robot that can move and sense in a 2D environment
- Implement [Graph SLAM](http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/thrun.graphslam.pdf) for this robot
